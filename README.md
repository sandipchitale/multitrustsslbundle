# Description

A simple Spring Boot App to show use of a composite TrustManager built from SsslBundle with RestTemplate.

It uses two trust stores 

- `server1-truststore.jks` to trust server at https://server1:8081 which uses self-signed certificate.
- `server2-truststore.jks` to trust server at https://server2:8082 which uses self-signed certificate.

which are wrapped in SslBundles named:

- `server1`
- `server2`

See [serversslbundle](https://github.com/sandipchitale/serversslbundle) git repo to run the two server instances.

Make sure to add these entries to /etc/hosts :

127.0.0.1 server1 server2 ...

It also registers third SslBundle named `JAVA_CACERTS_BUNDLE` that wraps Java's default cacerts trust store. 
This is used to trust public API which uses signed certificate.
